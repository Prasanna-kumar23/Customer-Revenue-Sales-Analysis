# Customer Revenue & Sales Analysis (Tableau)

In this project, I built an interactive **Tableau dashboard** to analyze customer revenue and sales performance across states, regions, age groups and discounts.

The dataset contains customer and transaction-level information, including:

- Customer demographics (age, gender, location)
- Order details (order date, month, year, item/category)
- Sales metrics (quantity ordered, price, total amount, discount)

I used Tableau to answer questions such as:

- Which **states** and **regions** generate the most revenue?
- How does revenue change **month by month**?
- How do **age groups** and **gender** contribute to sales?
- Is there any relationship between **quantity ordered** and **discounts**?

## Dashboard & Worksheets I Created

All views are combined into a single Tableau dashboard so a user can explore revenue and sales from different angles.  
The main worksheets in my Tableau workbook are:

- **Month-Wise Revenue**  
  I show how revenue changes over time (month level), which helps identify seasonal patterns and trends.

- **Revenue per State**  
  I compare revenue across states, so it’s easy to see which states are top performers.

- **Region-Wise Revenue Share (%)**  
  I visualize the share of total revenue by region to understand which regions contribute the most to overall sales.

- **Age-Wise Sales Analysis**  
  I analyze sales by age (using age bins) to see which age groups are the most valuable.

- **Gender-Wise Sales Analysis**  
  I compare sales between male and female customers to understand gender-based differences in purchasing.

- **Quantity – Discount Correlation**  
  I use this view to explore the relationship between quantity ordered and discounts, and see if higher discounts drive larger order quantities.

The dashboard includes interactive elements (filters, highlights, and tooltips) so the user can drill down and explore specific segments like region, age group or category.
